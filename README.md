# IClik: Information Criteria for Composite Likelihoods
``IClik`` is a minimal package for evaluating composite likelihood models using Composite Likelihood AIC and BIC (CLAIC/CLBIC).

For a review of these information criteria, please see: </br>

**This package is in development. Please let me know about any bugs or problems by raising an issue on GitHub.**


## Available information criteria

### Composite Likelihood AIC (CLAIC)
The composite likelihood version of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was proposed by Varin et al (2011). It is calculated as:

$$ CLAIC = -2L_{CL}(\hat\theta_{CL}) + 2tr[\mathbf{J}(\hat\theta_{CL})\mathbf{H}^{-1}(\hat\theta_{CL})] $$

Where $\mathbf{J(\theta)}$ and $\mathbf{H(\theta)}$ are the Jacobian and Hessian matrices of the likelihood function, and $\hat\theta_{CL}$ represents the composite maximum likelihood estimate.

### Composite Likelihood BIC (CLBIC)
CLBIC, formulated by Gao and Song (2010), is similar to CLAIC, but adjusts for sample size *n*:

$$ CLBIC = -2L_{CL}(\hat\theta_{CL}) + log(n) tr[\mathbf{J}(\hat\theta_{CL})\mathbf{H}^{-1}(\hat\theta_{CL})] $$

## Installation

``IClik`` is available via PyPi: ``pip install iclik``.

## Syntax
``IClik`` is very easy to use, provided that you have a correctly formulated likelihood function. A simple example of how to use it is provided here. 

Import ``claic``:
```python
from iclik.inform_crit import claic
```

First we need to define a composite likelihood function.
```python
def f(params):
    """I'm a composite likelihood function"""
    x, y, z = params
    return x**2 + y**2 + z**2
```

Running ``IClik`` is then a one-liner:
```python
claic(f, (1,2,3))
```
Output:
```python
-26.000000000000004
```
